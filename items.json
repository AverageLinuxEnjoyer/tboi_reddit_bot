Frozen enemies never unfreeze and are considered dead by the game. Kicking a frozen enemy will push it into the wall, where it shatters and fires ice shards everywhere (these can then freeze other enemies)\nEnemies touching the cube while it's not moving or moving slowly will become slowed for a few seconds, and take a small amount of damage\nCube Baby and enemies frozen will block enemy shots\nCube Baby can be launched across the room if you have a melee weapon\nCounts as 1 of 3 familiar items needed towards the Conjoined transformation.",
